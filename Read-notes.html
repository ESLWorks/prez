First, link the style sheet and the html sheet.
Create a title to be displayed in the tab.
Notice tabs have icons? Yeah? Those are favicons.
  Quick favicons can be made at https://www.favicon.cc/
Once you create your favicon, download it. Open the folder
you want it to be in. Then, in Chrome, drag the download.ext
 right into the folder you want the favicon in.
Favicons are linked in the head, using:
<!-- The url <link href="data:image/x-icon;base64,AAABAAEAEBAQAAEABAAoAQAAFgAAACgAAAAQAAAAIAAAAAEABAAAAAAAgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAD6APqBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABERERAiIiIAERERECIiIgAREREQIiIiABEQAAAiIAAAERAAACIgAAAREAAAIiAAABEREQAiIAAAERERACIgAAAREREAIiAAABEQAAAiIAAAERAAACIgAAAREREQIiAAABERERAiIAAAERERECIgAAAAAAAAAAAAD//wAAgIEAAICBAACAgQAAj48AAI+PAACPjwAAgY8AAIGPAACBjwAAj48AAI+PAACAjwAAgI8AAICPAAD//wAA" rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" />
Or the relative link <link rel="icon" rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="ABSOLUTE OR RELATIVE LINK"> -->

When styling with CSS, keep in mind the web browser applies default styling.
The browser has a style sheet called user agent stylesheet. Look up it up,
look at the assumptions, or at least read a quick summary on it so the fact
that the browser has default settings, sticks with you. You don't want to be
freaking out about your code not producing a desired result when it's the
web browser's assumptions in the way of the desired change.


Create a simple html page and inspect it in Google Chrome.
You'll see then that an H1 tag automatically has:
  h1 {
    display: block;
    font-size: 2em;
    margin-block-start: 0.67em;
    margin-block-end: 0.67em;
    margin-inline-start: 0px;
    margin-inline-end: 0px;
    font-weight: bold;
}
as default styles.

Know how people have distinguishable sections of a page?
You may have seen large centered text, behind a picture or a background?
Yeah, we're finally about to do that.

HTML and CSS uses boxes and alignment to position text, pics, etc.
With HTML div, we can divide up the content on a webpage. The thing is,
div doesn't make any apparent changes on the webpage without CSS.

<!-- Look, <div></div> doesn't make any apparent changes without CSS but with -->
div {
  height:100px;
} you get a 100px-high space. And you can actually see it by including
a line of CSS into the div above: background-color:COLOR;

div {
  height:100px
  background-color:blue;
}


Basic CSS properties to know:

elements (such as DIV):
- height:300 px; (0 px is written as just 0)
- width: 250 px; (0 px is written as just 0)
- border:
      - 1 border style listed = border for all 4 sides
      - 2 border listed = 1st top 2nd
